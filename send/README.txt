1. Match.doc
  Why I believe I'm the best match for FLUX

2. Architecture.doc
  Detailed explanation on various aspects of the system, it is a WIP, however it is an actionable document,
  upon which a system can be built very quickly. I already have some Java code for some of the modules, such
  as the security module, the other code I intend to build using code generators from schema. I also have an
  input validation library which can be used to model and write some of the code. We should have a demo of 
  some of the system live on the cloud very soon.

3. 306090.doc
  A strategic plan of action for the first 90 days, although my actual goal is to complete it earlier than that

4. SystemDiagram.png
  Very high lever system diagram, it's quite ugly for now, the nicer ones I'd created for other projects were 
  generated by software based on Schema and actual Code, I used Eclipse for those and SQL Manager for ERD.

5. Telematics Standard (Index only) PDF
  It shows some interesting information, some devices use the standard, the standard deals with the data itself.
  I don't believe the standard deals with the distribution, upload/download of the data. Some upload the data to
  the cloud and an API or other means are provided to access the data. Modules must be built individually depending
  on how the data can be downloaded.
